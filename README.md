### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

As a qualification of my Phase 1 Project(Data Analyisis) I was required to choose a dataset ,analyze and derive findings that will give helpful insights to microsoft company looking at starting a movie studio.

Settled on using three datasets namely:

imdb.title.basics
imdb.title.ratings
bom.movie_gross

The three dataframes were combined to come up with one (Combined_df) for easy manipulation and finding insights relatable to the all availablle data.

From this findings and insights should be retrived to recomend Microsoft company about their new adventure on starting a movie studio.

### Lead Questions include:

How many movies are being made of each genre?
What genres are the most successful, both in terms of audience rating and gross earnings?
How correlated is the Return on Investment to the Genres ratings ?

### Conclusions
We have drawn many interesting inferences from the dataset Netflix titles; here's a summary of the few of them:

The most genre type is drama with the least as war,

The amount of total Gross does affect the rating of the movie,

Some Genre Combinations are more relatable to each other unlike others.

### Recommendations
The studios that should be invested in should be either The mayor,Tomorrow or The way

The company should consider starting with the production of drama genre movies.
